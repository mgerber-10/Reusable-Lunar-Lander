# Reusable-Lunar-Lander

As part of a semester-long projet, worked in a group of six to design a reusable unmanned lunar lander that could successfully deliver a payload from one location to  another on the surface of the moon. My role in the group was lead structural engineer and my responsibilities included creating the entire CAD model of the lander including every other sub-teams parts and ensuring all standards of the project were met, such as weight limit and size limit.
